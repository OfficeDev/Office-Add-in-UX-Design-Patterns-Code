# Authentication Dialog Flow - Multiple Identity Providers

Use dialogs to present authentication screens to your end users. Consider this UX design pattern when using **multiple identity providers** or your add-in has **no space to display branded sign-in buttons**. Compare to [single identity provider ux design pattern](auth-single.md).
