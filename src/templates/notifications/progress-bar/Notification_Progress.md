### Notification - Progress

Progress bar indicates the progress of a long-running, synchronous process, such as a configuration task that must complete before the user can take any further action. It is a separate interstitial page that also reinforces the add-in brand. Use a progress bar when the process can send periodic measures of how far along it is back to the add-in.

Spinner indicates that a long-running, synchronous process is underway, but provides no indication of how far along it is. It is a separate interstitial page that also reinforces the add-in brand. Use a spinner when the add-in cannot know reliably how far along a process is.
